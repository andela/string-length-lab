You are presented with a string or a collection of strings

Your function should return the length of the string, or strings in an array

`['Fairy', 'tale']` should return `[5, 4]`

`'C-sharp'` should return `[7]`

## Instructions

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!
