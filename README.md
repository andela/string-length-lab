#String Length

You are presented with a string or a collection of strings

Your function should return the length of the string, or strings in an array

`['Fairy', 'tale']` should return `[5, 4]`

`'C-sharp'` should return `[7]`

## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\string-length.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.

##Notes

You should get familiar with javascript classes, prototyping, returning, and conditional statements.

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes are required. Prototyping of the Array class will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
